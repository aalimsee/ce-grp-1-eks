# In the CODEOWNERS file, define code owners by specifying file patterns followed by the GitHub usernames or team names. Hereâ€™s an example format:

# This is a comment
/docs @username1
*.js @dev-team

# The first line defines that all files within the /docs directory are owned by @username1. 
# The second line specifies that all JavaScript files (*.js) are owned by @dev-team. 

* @aalimsee_ce9
