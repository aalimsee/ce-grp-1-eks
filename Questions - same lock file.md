Both ce-grp-1-vpc and ce-grp-1-eks can and should use the same DynamoDB table:

hcl
dynamodb_table = "ce-grp-1-tf-locks"

🔍 Why This Works
The DynamoDB table (ce-grp-1-tf-locks) handles locking per Terraform state file, not per project.

Your S3 backend keys are different:
vpc/terraform.tfstate
eks/terraform.tfstate

So each module gets its own lock entry in the shared lock table.

✅ Benefits of Sharing the Lock Table
Benefit	Explanation
✅ Centralized locking	One table manages all state lock entries
✅ Simplified management	Only one table to secure and monitor
✅ Best practice for teams	Terraform module isolation + shared lock control

🧠 How It Works Internally
Terraform uses the S3 key path as the LockID:

json
LockID = "vpc/terraform.tfstate"
LockID = "eks/terraform.tfstate"
So there's no conflict between modules.

✅ Conclusion
Resource	Shared?	Notes
S3 Bucket	✅ Yes	Same bucket, different key paths
DynamoDB Lock Table	✅ Yes	Tracks locks per state key
